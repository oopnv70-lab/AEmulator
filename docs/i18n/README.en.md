# AEmulator — Honor MagicOS 12 fork

*Fork of [uxazu/AEmulator](https://github.com/uxazu/AEmulator); the engine it grew from is [Istratii-tech/SENSES](https://github.com/Istratii-tech/SENSES)*

**Run classic Android firmware — HTC Sense, TouchWiz, MIUI, AOSP — on a modern phone. No root, no PC.**

AEmulator boots a real Android 2.3–17 system image straight from a firmware file you already have: a recovery ZIP, an Odin archive, a Google factory image or a GSI. Old 32-bit firmware (2.3–4.4) runs through a patched QEMU, Android 5.0–17 runs natively on the phone’s arm64 cores. The kernel’s binder is emulated, graphics use your phone’s GPU and sound goes through Android’s audio stack — everything runs inside a normal app.

## ✨ Features

- Import almost any firmware format: CWM/TWRP ZIP, Samsung Odin `.tar.md5`, Google factory `.tgz`, `system.img`, OTA `system.new.dat.br`
- Vendor skins work as shipped: HTC Sense, Samsung TouchWiz, MIUI, AOSP
- Hardware graphics through the GL bridge, sound, touch and multitouch, network with a modern TLS proxy
- Shared memory-card folder for APKs, music and photos
- Material 3 Expressive interface in 18 languages
- Free and open source (GPL-3.0)

## 📱 Firmware list

This fork is being developed against official Honor MagicOS 12 (Android 12 / API 31, arm64). Upstream covers Android 2.3–17; nothing else has been tested in this fork.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/oopnv70-lab/AEmulator/releases) and install it.
2. Get a firmware file for the device you want to emulate (recovery ZIP, Odin package, factory image or GSI).
3. Open AEmulator → **Add firmware** and pick the file. Import takes a few minutes.
4. Press **Start**. The first boot is slower: the system optimises its apps.
5. Use the ⋮ menu for volume, power button and logs; the ⚙️ button opens app settings and language.

## 📋 Requirements

- Android 8.0+ on a 64-bit ARM phone (arm64-v8a)
- About 1–3 GB of free space per firmware
- A recent Snapdragon / Dimensity / Tensor chip is recommended

## ⚙️ How it works

On Android 2.3–4.4 each guest process runs under a patched user-mode QEMU; on 5.0–17 the firmware’s own arm64 programs run natively, with one engine kernel per Android version catching their system calls. A binder daemon replaces the kernel driver, a GL bridge forwards OpenGL ES calls to the phone’s GPU, and small guest libraries (audio HAL, audio policy wrapper, LD_PRELOAD shim) adapt vendor code to the emulator. The importer reads the firmware, finds the init scripts in its boot image and builds a start plan for system services.

## 🛠️ Build from source

You need JDK 17, Android SDK 36 and NDK r28. Native guest parts are built with the scripts in `native/*/build.sh`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oopnv70-lab/AEmulator.git
cd AEmulator
./gradlew :app:assembleV0003Debug
```

## 📌 What this branch does

This is **not** upstream AEmulator: it is a fork aimed at running official **Honor MagicOS 12 (Android 12 / API 31)** firmware. The upstream baseline is `0.0.0.3` (root commit `3b97ed5`); every commit after it is ours.

**Goal**: get official Honor MagicOS 12 firmware to boot to the home screen, install apps and be usable inside AEmulator.

### Fixed

- **system_server restarting in a loop over a missing VINTF manifest**: declare the framework-side HAL services the firmware leaves out (hidl.manager 1.0/1.2, hidl.token, frameworks.sensorservice, frameworks.displayservice, system.net.netd); rewrite the `<fqname>` form (13+) as the `<interface>/<instance>` form that 12 can parse; and merge the two versions of one HAL into a single `<hal>` block — two fragments make the parser of 12 reject the whole framework manifest as a conflict and report NULL VINTF MANIFEST

- **Vendor HALs stalling the boot**: a skip list for vendor hardware HALs in the start plan, plus a `run/skip-services` mechanism that skips a service at runtime

- **A setup wizard that could not be passed**: the Honor language picker is itself a setup wizard. A retry window (4 s / 8 s / 15 s / 30 s / 60 s) polls `dumpsys activity`; when the wizard is in front it is disabled with `pm disable-user` and HOME is brought up. This also fixes `skipWizardNow()` returning early on `bootCount > 0`, which meant the wizard was never skipped on images that had already booted

- **"Not enough space" when installing an app**: the root cause was storage path mapping. The engine's `sd[]` redirect table knows only eight paths, and this firmware declares its primary storage as `/storage/sdcard` — not one of them, so it stayed a plain empty directory inside the image. Firmware-owned storage points are now symlinked to a point the engine does map, and `/proc/mounts` gets a vfat entry for every storage point

### Known open issues

- **The storage screen still reads 0 B of free space.** Installing apps works, but the number is wrong. Checked against the AOSP 12 sources: the screen goes through `StorageStatsService.getFreeBytes()`, whose body is `path.getUsableSpace()`, i.e. a plain `statfs(2)` — it **never reads `/proc/mounts`**. Adding FUSE entries to the image's `/proc/mounts` therefore only makes the file *look* mounted; it cannot change what `statfs` returns. The real cause is not located yet and needs first-hand `df` / `statfs` data from inside the guest

- **Setting a lock-screen password reports "not enough storage".** It may share the cause above, or be unrelated: `run/gatekeeper-1-0.log` shows `Unable to open GateKeeper HAL` and a fatal signal 6 in `android.hardware.gatekeeper@1.0-service-qti`. Not confirmed

### Known limitation

The `app.aemu.SHELL` broadcast debug channel is gated on `BuildConfig.DEBUG`. The installed build is DEBUGGABLE, yet the broadcast never reached the receiver in testing (`dumpsys` shows `dispatchClockTime=1970`), so a guest `df` cannot be run this way. Diagnosis has to go through a file written by the app itself instead.
